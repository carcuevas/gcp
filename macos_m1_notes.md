# Things that are working
1. Terminal using iterm2 (external installation) support customization and multitabs
2. VScode (external installation)
3. Brave (external installation), Brave has different key bindings (Command instead of Control) and changing is possible just using extensions
4. Apple Main client works great with Gmail/O365 or custom mail server
5. Signal messanger only works using Rosetta emulator (mac offers to install it automatically)
6. Wireguard,OpenVPN,Forticlient works after installing external application. No native support
7. Ansible and Terraform can be installed via brew (First need to install homebrew)
8. External monitors and scalling works much better than in Linux

# Things annoy me
1. Keyboard layout Control,Win,Alt -> Control,Options,Command. I switched Options<->Command. Also in custom key binding I added Undo,Copy,Paste to standard Control+Z/C/V
2. Logitec mouse I could connect via Blootooth. Macos has Mouse connector but only for Apple mouse. This BT mouse feels a bit laggy sometimes (I didnt use dongle as no USB port in MacBook Air)
3. I got a feeling that in Apple store I never found anything I need
4. Control-C in iterm2 does not work as cancel (workaround to )
5. Randomly sometimes windows jumps from one virtual desktop to another and I have no idea why :)

# Not working
2. I cant access Printer Settings, getting error
