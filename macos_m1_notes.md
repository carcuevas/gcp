# Things that are working
1. Terminal using iterm2 (external installation) support customization and multitabs
2. VScode (external installation)
3. Brave (external installation), Brave has different key bindings (Command instead of Control) and changing is possible just using extensions
4. Apple Main client works great with Gmail/O365 or custom mail server
5. Signal messanger only works using Rosetta emulator (mac offers to install it automatically)
6. Wireguard,OpenVPN,Forticlient works after installing external application. No native support
7. Ansible and Terraform can be installed via brew (First need to install homebrew)
8. External monitors and scalling
9. Brave/Chrome remap Command-T/W to Control-T/W. Go to keyboard shortcuts,App shortcuts and make special "New Tab" and "Close Tab" shortcut. You must keep exact names
10. Same as number 9 you need to add custom for All application "Copy" "Paste" "Undo" to ctrl+c/v/z
11. To external keyboard to have same as laptop keyboard you need to switch Command<->Option
12. Photoshop and Lightroom are natively for M1 and works very fast

14. LibreOffice 7.1 works well. No performance difference noticed by Brittany
15. Docker works natively for ARM processor


# Things annoy me
1. Logitec mouse I could connect via Blootooth. Macos has Mouse connector but only for Apple mouse. This BT mouse feels a bit laggy sometimes (I didnt use dongle as no USB port in MacBook Air)
2. I got a feeling that in Apple store I never found anything I need
3. Randomly sometimes windows jumps from one virtual desktop to another and I have no idea why :)
4. Lot of customization for keys and shortcut needed for linux/windows user
5. Animations you cant switch it off completely 

# Not working and annoying things
1. I cant access Printer Settings, getting error
2. Check for update never finish
3. When I enabled firewall whole PC frozed, I needed to restart
4. Layout switching is buggy, sometimes works sometimes not
5. When you reboot or logout keys remaping get back to default
